for each state unit, the principle is that for every node you are listening out for, after your listener 
for that node has been called, your state has to be correct and appropriate for the context up to and including the node you just listened to.

e.g. the note-distance.ts stateunit might listen out for when we enter each ".Note". after the ".Note" listener is called, your note-distance
state must have the correct value corresponding to the distance of the .Note you just explored - i.e. your state's value (in this case your distance value) should
be the distance value for the Note you just explored, and not the distance for a previous Note (i.e. a note in a different sound) that was explored prior, or the distance for the next .Note that is to be explored.

This makes it so that other stateunits can consistently query your stateunit's current value and be assured that it is accurate.
