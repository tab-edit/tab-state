# tab-state
A configurable, rule-based state manager for the [tab-edit](https://github.com/tab-edit/tab-edit) system which acts as a single unified interface for interacting with and extending on the state of a tab syntax tree generated by the [tab-edit/tab-ast](https://github.com/tab-edit/tab-ast) project.

This method of state management makes it possible to more easily implement features such as linting or MusicXML generation as a set of pluggable and configurable "rules" on the tab syntax tree's state. 

As this rule-based system is pluggable and the default configuration for each rule can be changed to alter it's behaviour (just like an "./eslintrc" file), it would be very easy for users to add completely new functionality to the system, or customize how existing functionality works

This high customizability gives users the ability to customize how the tablature text is linted for example, or even customize how the tablature text is converted to the MusicXML format (by changing the default configuration of the rules that produce the final MusicXML state). This is a very important feature as ascii tablature is a highly unstandardized format

The design of this system is inspired by the open-source [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) project. 

## Contribution welcome
Feel free to contribute to the project if you would like to! There are definitely a bunch of rules that need to be written to make the system functional, so this might take some time :)
