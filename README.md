# tab-state
A rule-based state manager for the [tab-edit](https://github.com/tab-edit/tab-edit) system which acts as a single unified interface for interacting with and extending on the state of a tab syntax tree generated by the [tab-ast](https://github.com/tab-edit/tab-ast) project.

It makes it possible to easily implement features such as linting or MusicXML generation as a group of "rules" on the tab syntax tree state.
